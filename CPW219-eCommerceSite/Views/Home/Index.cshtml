            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p class="pi">In April of 1997, I received my A+ Certification, and my business opened its doors in late 1997,
                and
                Joe’s Discount Computers has continued ever since. Originally it was just friends and family that I
                serviced. Come
                April of 1999; I received a contract to perform services for my first business.</p>
            <p class="pi">Originally it was just computer repair and sales. In mid-1999, I added Network Design & setup.
                Then in
                early 2007, I added web hosting and web development. In mid-2014, until May 2017, I became the web developer
                for
                the Pierce County Council of St. Vincent de Paul.</p>
            <p class="pi">Come late September of 2017; I started my Associates in Computer Network Information System
                Services.
                I will finish my degree in March of 2021. After that, I will start my Bachelor of Applied Science in
                Cybersecurity.</p>

            <h3>About Guidelines</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="lit">Due to Lakewood ordinance, my particular type of business doesn't allow customers
                    visitations to
                    my workplace, so all business shall be completed at the customer&rsquo;s home. </li>
                <li class="lit">At my discretion, especially if it will take longer than the allotted time, I reserve the
                    right to
                    do the work at my place of business. If this happens, the milage fee will be waved for the return trip.
                </li>
                <li class="lit">There is no mileage fee for all clients with a Lakewood address, however the clock starts
                    when I
                    leave my previous appointment. Any other place will be charged a per-mile fee, based on the shortest
                    route to
                    the customer&rsquo;s home. We service from Tumwater, Olympia, Lacey, Dupont, Roy, Orting, Spanaway,

                <li class="lit">All appointments shall be made at least one week out. Unless you have an emergency that
                    needs to

                <li class="lit">If, by chance, I have to cancel your appointment, I will rebook it at the earliest
                    avalablile 
                    convenience and I&rsquo;ll wave the rush charge.</li>
